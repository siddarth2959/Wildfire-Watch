# Wildfire-Watch
🌲 Wildfire Risk Prediction & Monitoring

Using NASA FIRMS Data + NOAA/NWS Weather Data

🚀 Project Overview

This project provides a web-based platform for analyzing wildfire activity and predicting potential fire risks using satellite-derived fire detections (NASA FIRMS) and meteorological data (NOAA/NWS).
The system includes:

Wildfire detection visualization

Weather condition monitoring

Machine learning–based fire risk prediction
